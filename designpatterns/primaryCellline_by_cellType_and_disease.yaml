comment:
    text: "A specific cell type derived cell line by disease - CLO pattern. Example of usage:
    human breast cancer cell line equivTo 'primary cultured cell' and ('derives from' some
    (cell and ('part of' some ('organism part' and ('part of' some 'Homo sapiens'))))) and
    ('is model of' some 'breast carcinoma'). ---- NOTE: CLO uses obj.prop. 'is model for'
    that is in EFO namespace. However, EFO no longer has it - reusing RO's 'is model of'
    instead."
